<h1 style="color:red;"># File Organizer</h1>

<h2>File Organizer is a Python script that helps you organize your downloaded files into different categories. It categorizes files based on their file extensions and moves them into separate folders accordingly. This can be useful for keeping your downloads folder tidy and organized.</h2>

<h3>## Usage</h3>

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script in a terminal or command prompt.
3. The script will scan your downloads folder and categorize the files.
4. Files will be moved into folders named after their categories (e.g., Images, Documents, Videos, Music, Others).

## Customization

You can customize the script by editing the `file_categories` dictionary in the script. Add or remove file extensions and corresponding categories as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `os` and `shutil` modules (usually included in Python standard library)

## Note

Make sure to backup your files before running the script, as it will move files from your downloads folder.
